# Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe

On this project, we are creating a Terminal Tic-Tac-Toe game, using Ruby and following Object Oriented Programming and DRY rules.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rubocop

## Game Rules

This is a very simple Tic Tac Toe Game and it's played as follows:

- This game is a 1 vs 1 table game
- You will see a 3 by 3 board with 9 spaces in total
- Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an available space
- Available spaces are those that doesn't have a symbol in it
- The objective is to place 3 symbols in any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row
- If all spaces are taken and none of the player have won, the game ends in a draw
